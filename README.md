# ft_containers

# Description
This project's objective is to recreate the C++ containers Map, Stack, and Vector, in their C++98 state.

# How to use
If you want to test the mains, just type make in the terminal at the root of the project, and execute the containers_ft. The Containers_std is there to compare the behaviour between the standard implementation of the containers map, vector and stack with mine.
